====================================
Run your own Firefox Accounts Server
====================================

The Firefox Accounts server is deployed on our systems using RPM packaging,
and we don't provide any other packaging or publish official builds yet.

.. note:: This guide is preliminary and vastly incomplete. If you have any
   questions or find any bugs, please don't hesitate to drop by the IRC channel
   or mailing list and let us know.

.. note:: You might also be interested in
   `this Docker-based self-hosting guide <https://github.com/michielbdejong/fxa-self-hosting>`_
   (use at your own risk).

The Firefox Accounts server is hosted in **git** and requires **nodejs**.
Make sure your system has these, or install them:

- git: http://git-scm.com/downloads
- nodejs: http://nodejs.org/download

A self-hosted Firefox Accounts server requires two components: an auth-server
that manages the accounts database, and a content-server that hosts a web-based
user interface.

Clone the fxa-auth-server repository and follow the README to deploy your
own auth-server:

- https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/

Clone the fxa-content-server repository and follow the README to deploy your
own content-server:

- https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server/

Now direct Firefox to use your servers rather than the default, Mozilla-hosted
ones.  The procedure varies a little between desktop and Android Firefox.

In desktop Firefox, enter "about:config" in the URL bar:

  - if your Firefox version is 52 or later, you can (optionally) configure a
    custom FxA server by adding a single preference: Right click anywhere on the
    "about:config" page and choose *New > String*, and enter
    "identity.fxaccounts.autoconfig.uri" for the name, and your content-server
    URL for the value.

    - Note that this must be set prior to loading the sign-up or sign-in page
      in order to take effect, and its effects are reset on sign-out.

    - Additionally, if this preference is not set, then the rest of these
      instructions will still work, even if your Firefox version is greater or
      equal to 52.

  - Otherwise, search for items containing "fxaccounts", and edit them to use
    your self-hosted URLs:

    - use your auth-server URL to replace "api.accounts.firefox.com" in
      the following settings:

      - identity.fxaccounts.auth.uri

    - use your content-server URL to replace "accounts.firefox.com" in
      the following settings:

      - identity.fxaccounts.remote.signin.uri
      - identity.fxaccounts.remote.signup.uri
      - identity.fxaccounts.remote.force_auth.uri
      - identity.fxaccounts.settings.uri

    - You'll also need to run your own sync server -- see below.

    - You might have to restart Firefox for these changes to take effect.

Since Firefox 33, Firefox for Android has supported custom Firefox Account (and
sync) servers.  For Firefox 44 and later, enter "about:config" in the URL bar,
search for items containing "fxaccounts", and edit them to use your self-hosted
URLs:

  - use your auth-server URL to replace "api.accounts.firefox.com" in
    the following settings:

    - identity.fxaccounts.auth.uri

  - use your content-server URL to replace "accounts.firefox.com" in
    the following settings:

    - identity.fxaccounts.remote.webchannel.uri
    - webchannel.allowObject.urlWhitelist

  - optionally, use your oauth- and profile-server URLs to replace
    "{oauth,profile}.accounts.firefox.com" in

    - identity.fxaccounts.remote.profile.uri
    - identity.fxaccounts.remote.oauth.uri

**Important**: *after* creating the Android account, changes to
"identity.fxaccounts" prefs will be *ignored*.  (If you need to change the
prefs, delete the Android account using the *Settings > Sync > Disconnect...*
menu item, update the pref(s), and sign in again.)  Non-default Firefox Account
URLs are displayed in the *Settings > Sync* panel in Firefox for Android, so you
should be able to verify your URL there.

Prior to Firefox 44, a custom add-on was needed to configure Firefox for
Android.  For Firefox 43 and earlier, see the blog post `How to connect Firefox
for Android to self-hosted Firefox Account and Firefox Sync servers`_.

Since the Mozilla-hosted sync servers will not trust assertions issued by
third-party accounts servers, you will also need to :ref:`run your own
sync-1.5 server <howto_run_sync15>`.
