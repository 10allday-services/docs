====================
Loop Server API v1.0
====================

This document is based on the current status of the server. All the examples
had been done with real calls. It doesn't reflect any future implementation and
tries to stick with the currently deployed version.

This document describes the :ref:`HTTP APIs <http-apis>` and the
:ref:`Websockets APIs <websockets-apis>`.

HTTP APIs
=========

Overview
--------

.. note::

    Unless stated otherwise, all APIs are using application/json for the requests
    and responses content types. Parameters for the GET requests are form
    encoded (?key=value&key2=value2)

To ease testing, you can use `httpie <https://github.com/jkbr/httpie>`_ in
order to make requests. Examples of use with httpie are provided when possible.
In order to authenticate with hawk, you'll need to install the `requests-hawk
module <https://github.com/mozilla-services/requests-hawk>`_

Versioning
----------

The current API is versioned, using only a major version. All the endpoints for
version 1 are prefixed by `/v1/`. In case you don't specify the prefix, your
requests will be redirected automatically with an http `307` status.

.. _hawk-authentication:

Authentication
--------------

To deal with authentication, the Loop server uses `Hawk
<https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk>`_ sessions. When you
register, you can do so with different authentications schemes, but you are
always given an hawk session back, that you should use when requesting the
endpoints which need authentication.

When authenticating using the `/register` endpoint, you will be given an hawk
session token in the `Hawk-Session-Token` header. You will need to derive it,
as explained at :ref:`derive_hawk`.

.. _derive_hawk:

Derive hawk credentials from the hawk session token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to get the hawk credentials to use on the client you will need to:

1. Do an `HKDF derivation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF>`_ on the given
   session token. You'll need to use the following parameters::

    key_material = HKDF(hawk_session, "", 'identity.mozilla.com/picl/v1/sessionToken', 32*2)

2. The key material you'll get out of the HKDF need to be separated into two
   parts, the first 32 hex caracters are the hawk id, and the next 32 ones are the hawk
   key.

   Credentials::

        credentials = {
            'id': keyMaterial[0:32]
            'key': keyMaterial[32:64]
            'algorithm': 'sha256'
        }

Registration
------------

POST /registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Associates a Simple Push Endpoint (URL) with a user.
    Always return an hawk session token in the `Hawk-Session-Token` header.

    **May require authentication**

    You don't *need* to be authenticated to register. In case you don't
    register with a Firefox Accounts assertion or a valid hawk session, you'll
    be given an hawk session token and be connected as an anonymous user.

    This hawk session token should be derived by the client and used for
    subsequent requests.

    You can currently authenticate by sending a valid Firefox Accounts
    assertion or a valid Hawk session.

    Body parameters:

    - **simplePushURL**, the simple push endpoint url as defined in
      https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush#Definitions

POST /calls
~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Requires authentication**

    Similar to *POST /calls/{token}*, it creates a new incoming call to a known
    identity. Gets tokens and session from the provider and does a simple push
    notification, then returns caller tokens.

    Body parameters:

    - **calleeId**, array of strings containing the identities of the
      receiver(s) of the call. These identities should be one of the valid Loop
      identities (Firefox Accounts email or MSISDN) and can belong to none, an
      unique or multiple Loop users.
      It can also be an object with two properties:

      - **phoneNumber** The phone number on a local form
      - **mcc** The current SIM card Mobile Country Code

      In that case, the server will try to convert the phoneNumber as
      an MSISDN identity

    - **callType**, Specifies the type of media the remote party intends to

Rooms
-----

Some endpoints requires **owner** authentication, it is the account
used to create the room on the ``POST /rooms``.

On these endpoints only the owner can perform the action on the room.

Some endpoints requires **participants** authentification, it is
either the Hawk Session used to join the room using the :ref:`Hawk
Authorization scheme <hawk-authentication>` or the sessionToken the
user has got when joining anonymously using the :ref:`Basic Auth
Authorization scheme <basic-auth-authorization>`.

.. _basic-auth-authorization:

Basic Auth Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In that case, just use the room participant sessionToken as a Basic
Auth username with no password.

    http POST localhost:5000/rooms/:token --auth "_sessionToken_:"

    Authorization: Basic X3Nlc3Npb25Ub2tlbl86

GET /rooms
~~~~~~~~~~

    **Requires owner authentication**

    Retrieves a list of rooms owned by the owner.

    The response is a list of objects with this information:

    - **roomToken**, The token used to identify this room.
    - **roomName**, The name of the room.
    - **roomUrl**, A URL that can be given to other users to allow them to join the room.
    - **roomOwner**, The user-friendly display name indicating the name of the room's owner.
    - **maxSize**, The maximum number of users allowed in the room at
      one time (as configured by the room owner).
    - **clientMaxSize**, The current maximum number of users allowed
      in the room, as constrained by the clients currently
      participating in the session. If no client has a supported size
      smaller than "maxSize", then this will be equal to
      "maxSize". Under no circumstances can "clientMaxSize" be larger
      than "maxSize".
    - **creationTime**, The time (in seconds since the Unix epoch) at which the room was created.
    - **expiresAt**, The time (in seconds since the Unix epoch) at which the room goes away.
    - **participants**, An array containing a list of the current room
      participants. :ref:`More information about the participant properties <participant-information>`.

    - **ctime**, The time, in seconds since the Unix epoch, that any
      of the following happened to the room:

      - The room was created
      - The owner modified its attributes with "PATCH /rooms/{token}"
      - A user joined the room
      - A user left the room

.. _participant-information:

Participant information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    When retrieving the room information you get a list of participants.
    It is a list of objects with these properties:

    - **displayName**, The user-friendly name that should be displayed for this participant.
    - **account**, If the user is logged in, this is the FxA account
      name or MSISDN that was used to authenticate the user for this
      session.
    - **owner**, if the user is also the owner of the room, this
      property will be true, it will be false otherwise.
    - **roomConnectionId**, An id, unique within the room for the
      lifetime of the room, used to identify a partcipant for the
      duration of one instance of joining the room. If the user
      departs and re-joins, this id will change.


Account and Session
-------------------

DELETE /account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Requires authentication**

    Deletes the current account and all data associated to it.

    Example::

        http DELETE localhost:5000/v1/account --verbose \
        --auth-type=hawk --auth='c0d8cd2ec579a3599bef60f060412f01f5dc46f90465f42b5c47467481315f51:'

        Server-Authorization: <stripped>


DELETE /session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Requires authentication**

    Deletes the current session.

    This should be used to clear the hawk session of a Firefox Account
    user. You should not attempt to call this endpoint with a
    non-firefox account session, since it would mean as a client you
    could not attach a session anymore.

    In case you want to destroy a non-FxA session, please use the
    DELETE /account endpoint.

    Example::

        http DELETE localhost:5000/v1/session --verbose \
        --auth-type=hawk --auth='c0d8cd2ec579a3599bef60f060412f01f5dc46f90465f42b5c47467481315f51:'

        Connection: keep-alive
        Date: Wed, 16 Jul 2014 13:03:39 GMT
        Server-Authorization: <stripped>

    Potential HTTP error responses include:

    - **403 Forbidden:** If you remove this session you will loose
      access to your loop-server data because you will not be able to
      link them to a new session. Use DELETE /account instead.


Integration with Firefox Accounts using OAuth
---------------------------------------------

A few endpoints are available for integration with Firefox Accounts. This is
the prefered way to login with your Firefox Accounts for loop. For more
information on how to integrate with Firefox Accounts, `have a look at the
Firefox Accounts documentation on MDN
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_Accounts#Login_with_the_FxA_OAuth_HTTP_API>`_

POST /fxa-oauth/params
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Requires authentication**

    Provide the client with the parameters needed for the OAuth dance.

    - **client_id**, the client id used by the server;
    - **content_uri**, URI of the content server (to get account information);
    - **oauth_uri**, URI of the OAuth server;
    - **redirect_uri**, URI where the client should redirect once authenticated;
    - **scope**, The scope of the token returned;
    - **state**, A nonce used to check that the session matches.

GET /fxa-oauth/token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Requires authentication**

    Returns the current status of the hawk session (e.g. if it's authenticated or not)::

    Checks the validity of the given code and state and exchange it with a
    bearer token with the OAuth servers.

    The token is returned in the **access_token** attribute. A few additional
    parameters are returned:

    - **scope** the scope of the token;
    - **token_type** the type of the token returned (here, it will be
      "bearer").

Error Responses
---------------

All errors are also returned, wherever possible, as json responses
with a code, errno and error message.

Error status codes and codes and their corresponding outputs are:

- **404** : unknown URL, or unsupported application.
- **400** : malformed request. Possible causes include a missing
  option, bad values or malformed json.
- **401** : you need to be authenticated
- **403** : you are authenticated but don't have access to the resource you are
            requesting.
- **405** : unsupported method
- **406** : unacceptable - the client asked for an Accept we don't support
- **503** : service unavailable (provider or database backends may be down)

Also the associated errno can be one of:

- **105 INVALID_TOKEN**: This come with a 404 on a wrong call-url token;
- **106 BADJSON**: This come with a 406 if the sent JSON is not parsable;
- **107 INVALID_PARAMETERS**: This come with a 400 and describe
  invalid parameters with a reason;
- **108 MISSING_PARAMETERS**: This come with a 400 and list all missing parameters;
- **110 INVALID_AUTH_TOKEN**: This come with a 401 and define a problem during Auth;
- **111 EXPIRED**: This come with a 410 and define a EXPIRE ressource;
- **113 REQUEST_TOO_LARGE**: This come with a 400 and define a too large request;
- **114 INVALID_OAUTH_STATE**: This come with a 400 and tells the oauth state is invalid;
- **122 USER_UNAVAILABLE**: This come with a 400 and tell the user could not be found in the database;
- **201 BACKEND**: This come with a 503 when a third party is not available at the moment.


.. _websockets-apis:

Websockets APIs
===============

During the setup phase of a call, the websocket protocol is used to
let clients broadcast their state to other clients and to listen to
changes.

The client will establish a WebSockets connection to the resource
indicated in the "progressURL" when it receives it. The client never
closes this connection; that is the responsibility of the server. The
times at which the server closes the connection are detailed below. If
the server sees the client close the connection, it assumes that the
client has failed, and informs the other party of such call failure.

For forward compatibility purposes:

* Unknown fields in messages are ignored
* Unknown message types received by the client (indicating an earlier release)
  result in the client sending an "error" message ({"messageType": "error",
  "reason": "unknown message"}). The call setup should continue.
* Unknown message types received by the server result in the server sending an
  "error" message (as above); however, since this situation can only arise due to
  a misimplemented client or an out-of-date server, it results in call setup
  failure. The server closes the connection.

Call Setup States
-----------------

Call setup goes through the following states:

.. image:: /images/loop-call-setup-state.png

Call Progress Protocol
----------------------

Initial Connection (hello)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon connecting to the server, the client sends an immediate "hello" message,
which serves two purposes: it identifies the call that the progress channel
corresponds to (using the "callId"), as well as authenticating the connecting
user, so that they can be verified to be authorized to view/impact the call
setup state.

Note that the callId with which this connection is to be associated is encoded
as a component of the WSS URL.

UA -> Server::

   {
     "messageType": "hello",
     "auth": "''<authentication information>''"
   }


* `auth`: Information to authenticate the user, so that they can be verified to
  be authorized to access call setup information. This is the `websocketToken`
  returned by a POST to /calls/{token}, POST /calls and GET /calls.

If the hello is valid (the callId is known, the auth information is valid, and
the authenticated user is a party to the call), then the server responds with a
"hello." This "hello" includes the current call setup state.

Server -> UA::

   {
     "messageType": "hello",
     "state": "alerting"
     // may contain "reason" field for certain states.
   }

* `state`: See states in "progress", below.

If the hello is invalid for any reason, then the server sends an "error"
message, as follows. It then closes the connection.

Server -> UA::

   {
     "messageType": "error",
     "reason": "unknown callId"
   }

`reason`: The reason the hello was rejected:

* `unknown callId`
* `invalid authentication` - The auth information was not valid
* `unauthorized` - The auth information was valid, but did not match the
   indicated callId

Call Progress State Change (progress)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The server informs users of the current state of call setup. The state sent to
both parties ''is always the same state''. So, for example, when a user rejects
a call, he will receive a "progress" message with a state of "terminated" and a
reason of "rejected."

Server -> UA::

   {
     "messageType": "progress",
     "state": "alerting"
     // may contain optional "reason" field for certain events.
   }

Defined states are:

* `init`: The call is starting, and the remote party is not yet being alerted.
* `alerting`: The called party is being alerted (triggered by remote party
   sending a "hello" message).
* `terminated`: The call is no longer being set up. After sending a
  "terminated" message, the server closes the WebSockets connection. This message
  will include a "reason" field with one of the reason values described below.
* `connecting`: The called party has indicated that he has answered the call,
  but the media is not yet confirmed
* `half-connected`: One of the two parties has indicated successful media set
  up, but the other has not yet.
* `connected`: Both endpoints have reported successfully establishing media.
  After sending a "connected" message, the server closes the WebSockets
  connection.

Client Action (action)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During call setup, clients send progress information about their own state so
that it can be reflected in the call state.

UA -> Server::

   {
     "messageType": "action",
     "event": "accept"
     // May contain "reason" field for certain events
   }

Defined event types are:

* `accept`: Only sent by called party. The user has answered this call. This is
  sent before the called party attempts to set up the media.
* `media-up`: Sent by both parties. Communications have been successfully
  established.
* `terminate`: Sent by both parties. Ends attempt to set up call. Includes a
  "reason" field with one of values detailed below.

Termination Reasons
-------------------

The following reasons appear in "action"/"terminate" and "progress" /
"terminated" messages. The "√" columns indicate whether the indicated element
is permitted to generate the reason. When generated a "terminated" message as
the result of receiving a "terminate" action from either client, the server
will copy the reason code from the "terminate" action message into all
resulting "terminated" progress messages, ''even if it does not recognize the
reason code''.

To provide for forwards compatibility, clients must be prepared to process
"terminated" progress messages with unknown reason codes. The reaction to this
situation should be the display of a generic "call setup failed" message.

If the server receives an action of "terminate" with a reason it does not
recognize, it copies that reason into the resulting "terminated" message.

Timer Supervision
-----------------

Server Timers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The server uses three timers to ensure that the call created by a setup attempt
is cleaned up in a timely fashion.

Supervisory Timer
"""""""""""""""""

After responding to a ```POST /call/{token}``` or ```POST /call/user```
message, the server starts a supervisory timer of 10 seconds.

* If the calling user does not connect and send a "hello" in this time period,
  the server considers the call to be failed. The called user, if connected,
  will receive a "progress"/"terminated" message with a reason of "timeout".
* If the called user does not connect and send a "hello" in this time period,
  the server considers the call to be failed. The calling user, if connected,
  will receive a "progress"/"terminated" message with a reason of "timeout".

Ringing Timer
"""""""""""""

Upon receiving a "hello" from the called user, the server starts a ringing
timer of 30 seconds. If the called user does not send an "accept" message in
this time period, then both parties will receive a "progress"/"terminated"
message with a reason of "timeout".

Connection Timer
""""""""""""""""

Upon receiving an "accept" from the called user, the server starts a connection
timer of 10 seconds. If the call setup state does not reach "connected" in this
time period, then both parties will receive a "progress"/"terminated" message
with a reason of "timeout".

Client Timers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Response Timer
""""""""""""""

Every client message triggers a response from the server: "hello" results in
"hello" or "error"; and "action" will always cause a corresponding "progress"
message to be sent. When the client sends a message, it sets a timer for 5
seconds. If the server does not respond in that time period, it disconnects
from the server and considers the call failed.

Media Setup Timer
"""""""""""""""""

After sending a "media-up" action, the client sets a timer for 10 seconds. If
the server does not indicate that the call setup has entered the "connected"
state before the timer expires, the client disconnects from the server and
considers the call failed.

Alerting Timer
""""""""""""""

We may wish to let users configure the maximum amount of time the call is
allowed to ring (up to 30 seconds) before it considers it unanswered. This
timer would start as soon as user alerting begins. If it expires before the
call is set up, then the called party sends a "action"/"disconnect" message
with a reason of "timeout."
