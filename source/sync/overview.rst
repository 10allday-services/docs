Introduction
============

The purpose of Sync is to exchange browser data (bookmarks, history, open tabs, passwords, and the like) between "clients" in a manner that respects a user's security and privacy. Syncing behaviors are mediated by a server, which allows for syncing to occur without pairwise interaction between network-connected clients.

We shall begin by discussing the broad structure of the server, using digressions as necessary (after all, this is a story!). We will then step through a full setup and sync, outlining the HTTP requests and other operations that the client and server perform. There will be a brief diversion into encryption at the appropriate time.

The Sync server
===============

The storage server implements a dumb shared whiteboard, performing the vital role of storing records, tracking some elementary metadata and providing authenticated access, but otherwise playing only a small role in the actual activity of synchronizing browser data. In Firefox Sync, the clients perform the bulk of the work: generating, encrypting, and uploading records; reconciling incoming records; and updating the server accordingly. Of course, it 'must' be this way: if user data is encrypted, then the server 'cannot' help with synchronization.

The Sync server infrastructure exposes a secure HTTP interface for :ref:`user management and node assignment <reg>` as well as :ref:`storage <server_storage>`. Authentication, where applicable, is currently Basic Auth; this is a reasonable decision given the transport- and payload-level encryption used, but `Bug 445757 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=445757>`_ tracks work to move to an authentication mechanism that does not involve transmission of the user's password over the wire.

User accounts
=============

Every Sync user has an account. The account is identified by email address, with a 'username' value derived from this through SHA-1, base32-encoded. For example, if a user signs up with

  john@example.com

their account -- which appears in URLs and the Authorization HTTP header -- will be

  kismw365lo7emoxr3ohojgpild6lph4b

This account is associated with a password. The password secures access to the Sync server, as well as other sites that use the same authentication method (e.g., for Mozilla's Sync infrastructure, the Account Portal at https://account.services.mozilla.com/).

Collections
===========

The primary concept behind the Sync server's storage part is that of the 'collection'. Clients can store *objects* -- due to historical reasons, termed :ref:`Weave Basic Objects <storage_wbo>` -- into *collections*, and retrieve them by identifier or by metadata (e.g., modified since).

An important observation is that the server has no notion of a "sync" as understood by the client. From the server's perspective, there is simply a series of HTTP requests arriving from various IP addresses, performing REST-ish operations on a stateful backing store. The client has a well-defined sequence of actions that take place within a notional session, which can succeed or fail as a whole; the server does not.
