=========================
Profiling the application
=========================


    "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time:
    premature optimization is the root of all evil" 

     -- D. Knuth


The base application provides a Profiler that knows how to generate profiling
data that you'll be able to vizualize in *KCacheGrind*.

To enable it you can toggle the *profile* flag to **True** in your paster file.
See :ref:`Configuring the Profiler <profile-config>`. 

Restart your application using the built-in Paster server and start to use
it or run a load test on it (See :ref:`benching`).

Remember that once enabled, your application will be really slow because the
profiling is done by wrapping all calls in the Python interpreter.

You can display the profile information in real-time by visiting 
http://localhost:5000/__profile__

But the real work should be done in 
`KCacheGrind <http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net>`_. 
Once your have finished testing the application, stop it and you should find 
at the root of your application a :file:`cachegrind.out` file you can open.
