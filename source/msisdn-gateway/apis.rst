=======================
MSISDN Gateway API v1.0
=======================

This document is based on the current status of the server. All the
examples had been done with real calls. It doesn't reflect any future
implementation and tries to stick with the currently deployed version.

This document describes the HTTP API and the SMS API.

HTTP APIs
=========

.. note::

    Unless stated otherwise, all APIs are using application/json for the requests
    and responses content types. Parameters for the GET requests are form
    encoded (?key=value&key2=value2)

To ease testing, you can use `httpie <https://github.com/jkbr/httpie>`_ in
order to make requests. Examples of use with httpie are provided when possible.
In order to authenticate with hawk, you'll need to install the `requests-hawk
module <https://github.com/mozilla-services/requests-hawk>`_

Authentication
--------------

To deal with authentication, the MSISDN Gateway server uses `Hawk
<https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk>`_ sessions. When you
register, you can do so with different authentications schemes, but you are
always given an hawk session back, that you should use when requesting the
endpoints which need authentication.

When authenticating using the `/register` endpoint, you will be given an hawk
session token called `msisdnSessionToken` in the body. You will need to derive
as explained at :ref:`derive_hawk`.

APIs

GET /
~~~~~

    Displays version information, for instance::

       http GET localhost:5000 --verbose

    .. code-block:: http

        GET / HTTP/1.1
        Accept: application/json
        Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

        Connection: keep-alive
        Content-Length: 219

            "version": "0.5.0"
        }


POST /register
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Creates a new msisndSessionToken associated with an Hawk session.

    This is the first step to start verifying a new number.

    Example::

        http POST localhost:5000/register --verbose

    .. code-block:: http

        POST /register HTTP/1.1
        Accept: */*
        Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
        Content-Length: 0
        Host: localhost:5000
        User-Agent: HTTPie/0.8.0


        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
        Connection: keep-alive
        Content-Length: 94
        Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

        }

    Server should acknowledge your request, return a `msisdnSessionToken`
    and answer with a status code of **200 OK**.

    Potential HTTP error responses include:

    - **429 Too Many Requests:**  Client has sent too many requests (errno: 117)
    - **503 Service Unavailable:** Service temporarily unavailable due
      to high load or misconfiguration of the storage backend. (errno: 201)


POST /unregister
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **Requires authentication**

    Unregister an Hawk session.

    To revoke a device or once we don't want to use this validation
    number anymore, we can unregister the session token to prevent the
    user from continuing to generate BrowserID certificates with it.

    Example::

      http POST localhost:5000/unregister --verbose \
          --auth-type=hawk \
          --auth='8feb2f78227ff8f8d4addd8ba77c06d9ee7acb59d86bd78ae2fd94e242dfd1ee:'

    .. code-block:: http

        POST /unregister HTTP/1.1
        Accept: */*

        Authorization: Hawk mac="Tpny...a+A=", hash="B0we...z8=", id="bc...2f", ts="1406556506", nonce="E_GRLT"
        Content-Length: 0
        Host: localhost:5000
        User-Agent: HTTPie/0.8.0


        HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

        Date: Mon, 28 Jul 2014 14:08:26 GMT
        Server-Authorization: Hawk mac="lTGx...PNM=", hash="B0we...Uz8="


    Server should acknowledge your request and answer with a status code of
    **204 No Content**.

    Potential HTTP error responses include:

    - **401 Unauthorized:** The credentials you passed aren't valid. (errno: 109 or 110)
    - **429 Too Many Requests:**  Client has sent too many requests (errno: 117)
    - **503 Service Unavailable:** Service temporarily unavailable due
      to high load or misconfiguration of the storage backend. (errno: 201)

      of `verificationMethods` and whose values are the details of each
      method

    The methods listed in `verificationMethods` are sorted in the
    preferred order from the perspective of the server, i.e., the
    method listed first is the most preferred method.
