The URL for a Reg request is structured as follows::

    https://<server name>/<api path set>/<version>/<username>/<further instruction>

Certain functions use HTTP basic auth (over SSL, so as to maintain password
security). If the auth username does not match the username in the path, the
server will issue an Error Response

The Weave User API has a set of Weave Response Codes to cover errors in the
request or on the server side. The format of a successful response is defined
in the appropriate request method section. The Sync User API has a set of
:ref:`respcodes` to cover errors in the request or on the server side.
The format of a successful response is defined in the appropriate request
method section.


APIs
====

**GET** **https://server/pathname/version/username**

    Returns 1 if the username is in use, 0 if it is available. The answer is in
    plain text.

    Possible errors:

    - 503: there was an error getting the information


**GET** **https://server/pathname/version/username/node/weave**

    Returns the Weave (aka Sync) Node that the client is located on.
    Sync-specific calls should be directed to that node.

    Return value: <node>

    node may be 'null' if no node can be assigned at this time,
    probably due to sign up throttling.

    Possible errors:

    - 503: there was an error getting a node | empty body
    - 404: user not found | empty body


**GET** **https://server/pathname/version/username/password_reset**

    Requests a password reset email be mailed to the email address on file.
    Returns 'success' if an email was successfully sent.

    If captchas are enabled for the site, requires captcha-challenge and
    captcha-response parameters.

    Return value:

    - "success"

    Possible errors:

    - 503: problems with looking up the user or sending the email
    - 400: 12 (No email address on file)
    - 400: 3 (Incorrect or missing username)
    - 400: 2 (Incorrect or missing captcha)


**PUT** **https://server/pathname/version/username**

    Requests that an account be created for *username*

    The body is a JSON mapping and should include:

    - password: the password to be associated with the account.
    - e-mail: Email address associated with the account.
    - captcha-challenge: The challenge string from the captcha.
    - captcha-response: The response to the captcha.
    - secret: If set, the shared secret, which will override the captcha
      (for testing and automation)

    The server will return the lowercase username on success.

    Possible errors:

    - 503: there was an error creating the reset code
    - 400: 4 (user already exists)
    - 400: 6 (Json parse failure)
    - 400: 12 (No email address on file)
    - 400: 7 (Missing password field)
    - 400: 9 (Requested password not strong enough)
    - 400: 2 (Incorrect or missing captcha)


**POST** **https://server/pathname/version/username/password**

    Changes the password associated with the account to the value specified
    in the POST body.

    NOTE: Requires basic authentication with the username and (current)
    password associated with the account. The auth username must match the
    username in the path.

    Alternately, a valid X-Weave-Password-Reset header can be used,
    if it contains a code previously obtained from the server.

    Return values: "success" on success.

    Possible errors:

    - 400: 7 (Missing password field)
    - 400: 10 (Invalid ormissing password reset code)

    - 401: authentication failed


**POST** **https://server/pathname/version/username/email**

    Changes the email associated with the account to the value specified
    in the POST body.

    NOTE: Requires basic authentication with the username and password
    associated with the account. The auth username must match the
    username in the path.

    Alternately, a valid X-Weave-Password-Reset header can be used,
    if it contains a code previously obtained from the server.

    Return values: The user email on success.

    Possible errors:

    - 400: 12 (No email address on file)

    - 503: there was an error removing the user
    - 404: the user does not exist in the database
    - 401: authentication failed
